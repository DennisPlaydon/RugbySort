# RugbySort
This is a custom sorting algorithm that I used to apply directly to a data set to order a file according to various vactors such as points, difference in goals and max goals

This sorting algorithm using an insertion sort to order the elements of the file efficiently

*Note: This was a university project that I worked on, rather than a personal project.* Nonetheless I still took away valuable knowledge from this project. 

## What I learnt

I learnt the basics of sorting algorithms. This included the Big O notation of efficiency. I also learnt how to read content from a text file.
